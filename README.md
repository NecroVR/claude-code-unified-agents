## 🚀 Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/stretchcloud/claude-code-unified-agents.git

# Run the installation script
cd claude-code-unified-agents
./scripts/install.sh

# Or for specific agents only
./scripts/install.sh --agents backend-architect,frontend-specialist
```

### Manual Installation

1. **Project-level agents** (for current project only):
```bash
# Create agents directory in your project
mkdir -p .claude/agents

# Copy desired agents
cp -r claude-code-unified-agents/claude-code-unified-agents/.claude/agents/* .claude/agents/
```

2. **User-level agents** (available in all projects):
```bash
# Create global agents directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents

# Copy all agents
cp -r claude-code-unified-agents/claude-code-unified-agents/.claude/agents/* ~/.claude/agents/
```

## 📖 Usage

### Interactive Selection

Use the `/agents` command in Claude Code to interactively browse and select agents:

```
/agents
```

### Automatic Agent Selection

Claude will automatically select the most appropriate agent based on your request:

```
"Help me design a REST API for user management"
→ Automatically uses backend-architect
```

### Explicit Agent Invocation

Directly request a specific agent:

```
"@frontend-specialist create a React component for user authentication"
```

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

For complex tasks, use the orchestrator:

```
"@orchestrator Build a complete e-commerce platform with payment integration"
```

The orchestrator will:
1. Analyze requirements
2. Create a delegation plan
3. Coordinate multiple agents
4. Integrate results
